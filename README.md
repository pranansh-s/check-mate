# Xhess

Xhess is a modern chess platform featuring real-time gameplay, beautiful 3D visuals, and robust backend infrastructure. Built with performance, security, and scalability in mind.

Live Site: TBD

Features

- 🎮 Real-time multiplayer chess with Socket.IO
- 🔒 Secure authentication with Firebase
- 🔗 Monorepo structure to allow shared types & data
- ⚡ Performance optimized with Redis caching
- 📱 Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Zod for proper form validation
- 🏦 Redux for consistent state management
- 🧩 Follows SOLID principles in both frontend and backend
- 🐳 Dockerised system for easy integration anywhere
- 📊 Protection from DDOS attacks and familiar attacks by using proper rate limiting, headers and CORS policies

I'd also like to point out that the use of certain technologies or practices here like the monorepo structure, the extensive error handling, dockerization, or the redis cache layer in the backend aimed to reduce cost and load are not technically necessary and may look like an overkill for the current scale of this project.

The use of such practices and technologies is merely to showcase the POC (Proof-of-Concept) of a scalable, performant, verbose and secure web app along with the skills required for making one.
